# Whisperer

This really messy script combines [whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) from OpenAI and a [pytorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/forced_alignment_with_torchaudio_tutorial.html) on forced alignment to generate word-level .srt captions

## Usage

Install dependencies, put a `video.wav` file with a 16000 bitrate in the folder, run the script and pray it works.
